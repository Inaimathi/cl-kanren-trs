### Credits

`cl-kanren-trs` is an implementation of [miniKanren](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MiniKanren), the language discussed in [The Reasoned Schemer](http://www.amazon.com/The-Reasoned-Schemer-Daniel-Friedman/dp/0262562146). Therefore, thank you [Daniel Friedman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_P._Friedman), [William Byrd](http://www.infoq.com/interviews/byrd-relational-programming-minikanren) and Oleg Kiselyov (whom I'm having trouble finding a link to).

This repo was forked from [this](http://common-lisp.net/project/cl-kanren-trs/) `common-lisp.net` project. Therefore, thank you Matthew Swank (whom I also can't positively identify except for [that project page](http://common-lisp.net/project/cl-kanren-trs/)).
